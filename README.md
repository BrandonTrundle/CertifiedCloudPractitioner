## 🧩 How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with the Lesson Plans**  
   → Follow them in order (`Lesson Plan Day 1.md`, etc.).  
   Each plan references the corresponding questions and study files.

2. **Try Questions Without Answers First**  
   → Attempt to explain each concept in your own words before checking the “with answers” folder.

3. **Compare and Learn**  
   → Read the graded feedback inside _Learning Sessions_ to understand how AWS expects you to reason.

4. **Use as a Teaching Tool**  
   → If you mentor others, these materials are organized so you can replicate the session-based structure.
